# Results NOTE

Anzograph pointed out that I did not do warm-up runs before timing responses. AnzoGraph completes C++ compilations on the first run of a query so this likely skewed the results. I did some initial testing of this and AnzoGraph does seem competitive if you ignore the first response time. I will complete a more comprehensive evaluation with warm-up runs and link here when published.
